Unlike the txt2img.py and img2img.py scripts provided in the original CompVis/stable-diffusion source code repository, the time-consuming initialization of the AI model initialization only happens once. After that image generation from the command-line interface is very fast. The script uses the readline library to allow for in-line editing, command history ( Up and Down ), autocompletion, and more. To help keep track of which prompts generated which images, the script writes a log file of image names and prompts to the selected output directory. In addition, as of version 1.02, it also writes the prompt into the PNG file's metadata where it can be retrieved using scripts/images2prompt.py The script is confirmed to work on Linux, Windows and Mac systems. Note This script runs from the command-line or can be used as a Web application. The Web GUI is currently rudimentary, but a much better replacement is on its way.

A significant change is that creation of individual images is now the default unless --grid ( -g ) is given. A full list is given in List of prompt arguments . Arguments # The script itself also recognizes a series of command-line switches that will change important global defaults, such as the directory for image outputs and the location of the model weight files. List of arguments recognized at the command line # These command-line arguments can be passed to dream.py when you first run it from the Windows, Mac or Linux command line. Some set defaults that can be overridden on a per-prompt basis (see [List of prompt arguments] (#list-of-prompt-arguments). Others Argument Shortcut Default Description --help -h Print a concise help message. --outdir <path> -o<path> outputs/img_samples Location for generated images. --prompt_as_dir -p False Name output directories using the prompt text. --from_file <path> None Read list of prompts from a file. Use - to read from standard input --model <modelname> stable-diffusion-1.4 Loads model specified in configs/models.yaml. Currently one of \"stable-diffusion-1.4\" or \"laion400m\" --full_precision -F False Run in slower full-precision mode. Needed for Macintosh M1/M2 hardware and some older video cards. --web False Start in web server mode --host <ip addr> localhost Which network interface web server should listen on. Set to 0.0.0.0 to listen on any. --port <port> 9090 Which port web server should listen for requests on. --config <path> configs/models.yaml Configuration file for models and their weights. --iterations <int> -n<int> 1 How many images to generate per prompt. --grid -g False Save all image series as a grid rather than individually. --sampler <sampler> -A<sampler> k_lms Sampler to use. Use -h to get list of available samplers. --seamless False Create interesting effects by tiling elements of the image. --embedding_path <path> None Path to pre-trained embedding manager checkpoints, for custom models --gfpgan_dir src/gfpgan Path to where GFPGAN is installed. --gfpgan_model_path experiments/pretrained_models/GFPGANv1.4.pth Path to GFPGAN model file, relative to --gfpgan_dir . --device <device> -d<device> torch.cuda.current_device() Device to run SD on, e.g. \"cuda:0\" deprecated # These arguments are deprecated but still work: Argument Shortcut Default Description --weights None Pth to weights file; use --model stable-diffusion-1.4 instead --laion400m -l False Use older LAION400m weights; use --model=laion400m instead A note on path names: On Windows systems, you may run into problems when passing the dream script standard backslashed path names because the Python interpreter treats \"\\\" as an escape. You can either double your slashes (ick): C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\my\\\\file, or use Linux/Mac style forward slashes (better): C:/path/to/my/file. List of prompt arguments # After the dream.py script initializes, it will present you with a dream> prompt. Here you can enter information to generate images from text (txt2img), to embellish an existing image or sketch (img2img), or to selectively alter chosen regions of the image (inpainting). This is an example of txt2img: # dream> waterfall and rainbow -W640 -H480 This will create the requested image with the dimensions 640 (width) and 480 (height). Here are the dream> command that apply to txt2img: Argument Shortcut Default Description \"my prompt\" Text prompt to use. The quotation marks are optional. --width -W 512 Width of generated image --height -H 512 Height of generated image --iterations -n 1 How many images to generate from this prompt --steps -s 50 How many steps of refinement to apply --cfg_scale -C 7.5 How hard to try to match the prompt to the generated image; any number greater than 1.0 works, but the useful range is roughly 5.0 to 20.0 --seed -S None Set the random seed for the next series of images. This can be used to recreate an image generated previously. --sampler -A k_lms Sampler to use. Use -h to get list of available samplers. --grid -g False Turn on grid mode to return a single image combining all the images generated by this prompt --individual -i True Turn off grid mode (deprecated; leave off --grid instead) --outdir -o outputs/img_samples Temporarily change the location of these images --seamless False Activate seamless tiling for interesting effects --log_tokenization -t False Display a color-coded list of the parsed tokens derived from the prompt --skip_normalization -x False Weighted subprompts will not be normalized. See Weighted Prompts --upscale -U -U 1 0.75 Upscale image by magnification factor (2, 4), and set strength of upscaling (0.0-1.0). If strength not set, will default to 0.75. --gfpgan_strength -G -G0 Fix faces using the GFPGAN algorithm; argument indicates how hard the algorithm should try (0.0-1.0) --save_original -save_orig False When upscaling or fixing faces, this will cause the original image to be saved rather than replaced. --variation -v 0.0 Add a bit of noise (0.0=none, 1.0=high) to the image in order to generate a series of variations. Usually used in combination with -S and -n to generate a series a riffs on a starting image. See Variations . --with_variations -V None Combine two or more variations. See Variations for now to use this. Note that the width and height of the image must be multiples of 64. You can provide different values, but they will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 64. This is an example of img2img: # dream> waterfall and rainbow -I./vacation-photo.png -W640 -H480 --fit This will modify the indicated vacation photograph by making it more like the prompt. Results will vary greatly depending on what is in the image. We also ask to --fit the image into a box no bigger than 640x480. Otherwise the image size will be identical to the provided photo and you may run out of memory if it is large. In addition to the command-line options recognized by txt2img, img2img accepts additional options: Argument Shortcut Default Description --init_img -I None Path to the initialization image --fit -F False Scale the image to fit into the specified -H and -W dimensions --strength -s 0.75 How hard to try to match the prompt to the initial image. Ranges from 0.0-0.99, with higher values replacing the initial image completely. This is an example of inpainting: # dream> waterfall and rainbow -I./vacation-photo.png -M./vacation-mask.png -W640 -H480 --fit This will do the same thing as img2img, but image alterations will only occur within transparent areas defined by the mask file specified by -M. You may also supply just a single initial image with the areas to overpaint made transparent, but you must be careful not to destroy the pixels underneath when you create the transparent areas. See Inpainting for details. inpainting accepts all the arguments used for txt2img and img2img, as well as the --mask (-M) argument: Argument Shortcut Default Description --init_mask -M None Path to an image the same size as the initial_image, with areas for inpainting made transparent. Command-line editing and completion # If you are on a Macintosh or Linux machine, the command-line offers convenient history tracking, editing, and command completion. To scroll through previous commands and potentially edit/reuse them, use the up and down cursor keys. To edit the current command, use the left and right cursor keys to position the cursor, and then backspace, delete or insert characters. To move to the very beginning of the command, type CTRL-A (or command-A on the Mac) To move to the end of the command, type CTRL-E. To cut a section of the command, position the cursor where you want to start cutting and type CTRL-K. To paste a cut section back in, position the cursor where you want to paste, and type CTRL-Y Windows users can get similar, but more limited, functionality if they launch dream.py with the \"winpty\" program: > winpty python scripts\\dream.py On the Mac and Linux platforms, when you exit dream.py, the last 1000 lines of your command-line history will be saved. When you restart dream.py, you can access the saved history using the up-arrow key. In addition, limited command-line completion is installed. In various contexts, you can start typing your command and press tab. A list of potential completions will be presented to you. You can then type a little more, hit tab again, and eventually autocomplete what you want. When specifying file paths using the one-letter shortcuts, the CLI will attempt to complete pathnames for you. This is most handy for the -I (init image) and -M (init mask) paths. To initiate completion, start the path with a slash (\"/\") or \"./\". For example: ~ dream> zebra with a mustache -I./test-pictures -I./test-pictures/Lincoln-and-Parrot.png -I./test-pictures/zebra.jpg -I./test-pictures/madonna.png -I./test-pictures/bad-sketch.png -I./test-pictures/man_with_eagle/ ``` You can then type Z , hit Tab again, and it will autofill to zebra.jpg .

After that image generation from the command-line interface is very fast. The script uses the readline library to allow for in-line editing, command history ( Up and Down ), autocompletion, and more. To help keep track of which prompts generated which images, the script writes a log file of image names and prompts to the selected output directory. In addition, as of version 1.02, it also writes the prompt into the PNG file's metadata where it can be retrieved using scripts/images2prompt.py The script is confirmed to work on Linux, Windows and Mac systems. Note This script runs from the command-line or can be used as a Web application. The Web GUI is currently rudimentary, but a much better replacement is on its way.

In order to avoid crashes and memory overloads during the Stable Diffusion process, these effects are applied after Stable Diffusion has completed its work. In single image generations, you will see the output right away but when you are using multiple iterations, the images will first be generated and then upscaled and face restored after that process is complete. While the image generation is taking place, you will still be able to preview the base images. If you wish to stop during the image generation but want to upscale or face restore a particular generated image, pass it again with the same prompt and generated seed along with the -U and -G prompt arguments to perform those actions. Embiggen # If you wanted to be able to do more (pixels) without running out of VRAM, or you want to upscale with details that couldn't possibly appear without the context of a prompt, this is the feature to try out. Embiggen automates the process of taking an init image, upscaling it, cutting it into smaller tiles that slightly overlap, running all the tiles through img2img to refine details with respect to the prompt, and \"stitching\" the tiles back together into a cohesive image. It automatically computes how many tiles are needed, and so it can be fed ANY size init image and perform Img2Img on it (though it will be run only one tile at a time, which can cause problems, see the Note at the end). If you're familiar with \"GoBig\" (ala progrock-stable ) it's similar to that, except it can work up to an arbitrarily large size (instead of just 2x), with tile overlaps configurable as a ratio, and has extra logic to re-run any number of the tile sub-sections of the image if for example a small part of a huge run got messed up. Usage # -embiggen <scaling_factor> <esrgan_strength> <overlap_ratio OR overlap_pixels> Takes a scaling factor relative to the size of the --init_img ( -I ), followed by ESRGAN upscaling strength (0 - 1.0), followed by minimum amount of overlap between tiles as a decimal ratio (0 - 1.0) OR a number of pixels. The scaling factor is how much larger than the --init_img the output should be, and will multiply both x and y axis, so an image that is a scaling factor of 3.0 has 3*3= 9 times as many pixels, and will take (at least) 9 times as long (see overlap for why it might be longer). If the --init_img is already the right size -embiggen 1 , and it can also be less than one if the init_img is too big. Esrgan_strength defaults to 0.75, and the overlap_ratio defaults to 0.25, both are optional. Unlike Img2Img, the --width ( -W ) and --height ( -H ) arguments do not control the size of the image as a whole, but the size of the tiles used to Embiggen the image. ESRGAN is used to upscale the --init_img prior to cutting it into tiles/pieces to run through img2img and then stitch back together. Embiggen can be run without ESRGAN; just set the strength to zero (e.g. -embiggen 1.75 0 ). The output of Embiggen can also be upscaled after it's finished ( -U ). The overlap is the minimum that tiles will overlap with adjacent tiles, specified as either a ratio or a number of pixels. How much the tiles overlap determines the likelihood the tiling will be noticable, really small overlaps (e.g. a couple of pixels) may produce noticeable grid-like fuzzy distortions in the final stitched image. Though, as the overlapping space doesn't contribute to making the image bigger, and the larger the overlap the more tiles (and the more time) it will take to finish. Because the overlapping parts of tiles don't \"contribute\" to increasing size, every tile after the first in a row or column effectively only covers an extra 1 - overlap_ratio on each axis. If the input/ --init_img is same size as a tile, the ideal (for time) scaling factors with the default overlap (0.25) are 1.75, 2.5, 3.25, 4.0 etc.. -embiggen_tiles <spaced list of tiles> An advanced usage useful if you only want to alter parts of the image while running Embiggen. It takes a list of tiles by number to run and replace onto the initial image e.g. 1 3 5 . It's useful for either fixing problem spots from a previous Embiggen run, or selectively altering the prompt for sections of an image - for creative or coherency reasons. Tiles are numbered starting with one, and left-to-right, top-to-bottom. So, if you are generating a 3x3 tiled image, the middle row would be 4 5 6 . Example Usage # Running Embiggen with 512x512 tiles on an existing image, scaling up by a factor of 2.5x; and doing the same again (default ESRGAN strength is 0.75, default overlap between tiles is 0.25): dream > a photo of a forest at sunset -s 100 -W 512 -H 512 -I outputs/forest.png -f 0 .4 -embiggen 2 .5 dream > a photo of a forest at sunset -s 100 -W 512 -H 512 -I outputs/forest.png -f 0 .4 -embiggen 2 .5 0 .75 0 .25 If your starting image was also 512x512 this should have taken 9 tiles. If there weren't enough clouds in the sky of that forest you just made (and that image is about 1280 pixels (512*2.5) wide A.K.A. three 512x512 tiles with 0.25 overlaps wide) we can replace that top row of tiles: dream> a photo of puffy clouds over a forest at sunset -s 100 -W 512 -H 512 -I outputs/000002.seed.png -f 0 .5 -embiggen_tiles 1 2 3 Fixing Previously-Generated Images # It is easy to apply embiggen to any previously-generated file without having to look up the original prompt and provide an initial image. Just use the syntax !fix path/to/file.png <embiggen> . For example, you can rewrite the previous command to look like this: dream> !fix ./outputs/000002.seed.png -embiggen_tiles 1 2 3 A new file named 000002.seed.fixed.png will be created in the output directory. Note that the !fix command does not replace the original file, unlike the behavior at generate time. You do not need to provide the prompt, and !fix automatically selects a good strength for embiggen-ing. Note Because the same prompt is used on all the tiled images, and the model doesn't have the context of anything outside the tile being run - it can end up creating repeated pattern (also called 'motifs') across all the tiles based on that prompt. The best way to combat this is lowering the --strength ( -f ) to stay more true to the init image, and increasing the number of steps so there is more compute-time to create the detail. Anecdotally --strength 0.35-0.45 works pretty well on most things. It may also work great in some examples even with the --strength set high for patterns, landscapes, or subjects that are more abstract. Because this is (relatively) fast, you can also preserve the best parts from each.

To do it, you start with an initial image and use a photoeditor to make one or more regions transparent (i.e. they have a \"hole\" in them). You then provide the path to this image at the dream> command line using the -I switch. Stable Diffusion will only paint within the transparent region. There's a catch. In the current implementation, you have to prepare the initial image correctly so that the underlying colors are preserved under the transparent area. Many imaging editing applications will by default erase the color information under the transparent pixels and replace them with white or black, which will lead to suboptimal inpainting. You also must take care to export the PNG file in such a way that the color information is preserved. If your photoeditor is erasing the underlying color information, dream.py will give you a big fat warning. If you can't find a way to coax your photoeditor to retain color values under transparent areas, then you can combine the -I and -M switches to provide both the original unedited image and the masked (partially transparent) image: dream> \"man with cat on shoulder\" -I./images/man.png -M./images/man-transparent.png We are hoping to get rid of the need for this workaround in an upcoming release.","title":"Creating Transparent Regions for Inpainting"},{"location":"features/INPAINTING/#recipe-for-gimp","text":"GIMP is a popular Linux photoediting tool.

You can apply these operations at the time you generate the images, or at any time to a previously-generated PNG file, using the !fix command. Face Fixing # The default face restoration module is GFPGAN. The default upscale is Real-ESRGAN. For an alternative face restoration module, see [CodeFormer Support] below. As of version 1.14, environment.yaml will install the Real-ESRGAN package into the standard install location for python packages, and will put GFPGAN into a subdirectory of \"src\" in the stable-diffusion directory. (The reason for this is that the standard GFPGAN distribution has a minor bug that adversely affects image color.) Upscaling with Real-ESRGAN should \"just work\" without further intervention. Simply pass the --upscale (-U) option on the dream> command line, or indicate the desired scale on the popup in the Web GUI. For GFPGAN to work, there is one additional step needed. You will need to download and copy the GFPGAN models file into src/gfpgan/experiments/pretrained_models . On Mac and Linux systems, here's how you'd do it using wget : > wget https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.4.pth src/gfpgan/experiments/pretrained_models/ Make sure that you're in the stable-diffusion directory when you do this. Alternatively, if you have GFPGAN installed elsewhere, or if you are using an earlier version of this package which asked you to install GFPGAN in a sibling directory, you may use the --gfpgan_dir argument with dream.py to set a custom path to your GFPGAN directory. There are other GFPGAN related boot arguments if you wish to customize further. Internet connection needed Users whose GPU machines are isolated from the Internet (e.g. on a University cluster) should be aware that the first time you run dream.py with GFPGAN and Real-ESRGAN turned on, it will try to download model files from the Internet. To rectify this, you may run python3 scripts/preload_models.py after you have installed GFPGAN and all its dependencies. Usage # You will now have access to two new prompt arguments. Upscaling # -U : <upscaling_factor> <upscaling_strength> The upscaling prompt argument takes two values. The first value is a scaling factor and should be set to either 2 or 4 only. This will either scale the image 2x or 4x respectively using different models. You can set the scaling stength between 0 and 1.0 to control intensity of the of the scaling. This is handy because AI upscalers generally tend to smooth out texture details. If you wish to retain some of those for natural looking results, we recommend using values between 0.5 to 0.8 . If you do not explicitly specify an upscaling_strength, it will default to 0.75. Face Restoration # -G : <gfpgan_strength> This prompt argument controls the strength of the face restoration that is being applied. Similar to upscaling, values between 0.5 to 0.8 are recommended. You can use either one or both without any conflicts. In cases where you use both, the image will be first upscaled and then the face restoration process will be executed to ensure you get the highest quality facial features. --save_orig When you use either -U or -G , the final result you get is upscaled or face modified. If you want to save the original Stable Diffusion generation, you can use the -save_orig prompt argument to save the original unaffected version too. Example Usage # dream> superman dancing with a panda bear -U 2 0 .6 -G 0 .4 This also works with img2img: dream> a man wearing a pineapple hat -I path/to/your/file.png -U 2 0 .5 -G 0 .6 Note GFPGAN and Real-ESRGAN are both memory intensive. In order to avoid crashes and memory overloads during the Stable Diffusion process, these effects are applied after Stable Diffusion has completed its work. In single image generations, you will see the output right away but when you are using multiple iterations, the images will first be generated and then upscaled and face restored after that process is complete. While the image generation is taking place, you will still be able to preview the base images. If you wish to stop during the image generation but want to upscale or face restore a particular generated image, pass it again with the same prompt and generated seed along with the -U and -G prompt arguments to perform those actions. CodeFormer Support # This repo also allows you to perform face restoration using CodeFormer . In order to setup CodeFormer to work, you need to download the models like with GFPGAN. You can do this either by running preload_models.py or by manually downloading the model file and saving it to ldm/restoration/codeformer/weights folder.

In this document, we will talk about sampler convergence. Looking for a short version? Here's a TL;DR in 3 tables. Remember Results converge as steps ( -s ) are increased (except for K_DPM_2_A and K_EULER_A ). Often at \u2265 -s100 , but may require \u2265 -s700 ). Producing a batch of candidate images at low ( -s8 to -s30 ) step counts can save you hours of computation. K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 converge in less steps (but are slower). K_DPM_2_A and K_EULER_A incorporate a lot of creativity/variability. Sampler (3 sample avg) it/s (M1 Max 64GB, 512x512) DDIM 1.89 PLMS 1.86 K_EULER 1.86 K_LMS 1.91 K_HEUN 0.95 (slower) K_DPM_2 0.95 (slower) K_DPM_2_A 0.95 (slower) K_EULER_A 1.86 Suggestions For most use cases, K_LMS , K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 are the best choices (the latter 2 run 0.5x as quick, but tend to converge 2x as quick as K_LMS ). At very low steps (\u2264 -s8 ), K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 are not recommended. Use K_LMS instead. For variability, use K_EULER_A (runs 2x as quick as K_DPM_2_A ). Sampler results # Let's start by choosing a prompt and using it with each of our 8 samplers, running it for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 steps. Anime. \"an anime girl\" -W512 -H512 -C7.5 -S3031912972 Sampler convergence # Immediately, you can notice results tend to converge -that is, as -s (step) values increase, images look more and more similar until there comes a point where the image no longer changes. You can also notice how DDIM and PLMS eventually tend to converge to K-sampler results as steps are increased. Among K-samplers, K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 seem to require the fewest steps to converge, and even at low step counts they are good indicators of the final result. And finally, K_DPM_2_A and K_EULER_A seem to do a bit of their own thing and don't keep much similarity with the rest of the samplers. Batch generation speedup # This realization is very useful because it means you don't need to create a batch of 100 images ( -n100 ) at -s100 to choose your favorite 2 or 3 images. You can produce the same 100 images at -s10 to -s30 using a K-sampler (since they converge faster), get a rough idea of the final result, choose your 2 or 3 favorite ones, and then run -s100 on those images to polish some details. The latter technique is 3-8x as quick. Example: At 60s per 100 steps. (Option A) 60s * 100 images = 6000s (100 images at -s100 , manually picking 3 favorites) (Option B) 6s * 100 images + 60s * 3 images = 780s (100 images at -s10 , manually picking 3 favorites, and running those 3 at -s100 to polish details) The result is 1 hour and 40 minutes (Option A) vs 13 minutes (Option B). Topic convergance # Now, these results seem interesting, but do they hold for other topics? How about nature? Food? People? Animals? Let's try! Nature. \"valley landscape wallpaper, d&d art, fantasy, painted, 4k, high detail, sharp focus, washed colors, elaborate excellent painted illustration\" -W512 -H512 -C7.5 -S1458228930 With nature, you can see how initial results are even more indicative of final result -more so than with characters/people. K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 are again the quickest indicators, almost right from the start. Results also converge faster (e.g. K_HEUN converged at -s21 ). Food. \"a hamburger with a bowl of french fries\" -W512 -H512 -C7.5 -S4053222918 Again, K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 take the fewest number of steps to be good indicators of the final result. K_DPM_2_A and K_EULER_A seem to incorporate a lot of creativity/variability, capable of producing rotten hamburgers, but also of adding lettuce to the mix. And they're the only samplers that produced an actual 'bowl of fries'! Animals. \"grown tiger, full body\" -W512 -H512 -C7.5 -S3721629802 K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 once again require the least number of steps to be indicative of the final result (around -s30 ), while other samplers are still struggling with several tails or malformed back legs. It also takes longer to converge (for comparison, K_HEUN required around 150 steps to converge). This is normal, as producing human/animal faces/bodies is one of the things the model struggles the most with. For these topics, running for more steps will often increase coherence within the composition. People. \"Ultra realistic photo, (Miranda Bloom-Kerr), young, stunning model, blue eyes, blond hair, beautiful face, intricate, highly detailed, smooth, art by artgerm and greg rutkowski and alphonse mucha, stained glass\" -W512 -H512 -C7.5 -S2131956332 . This time, we will go up to 300 steps. Observing the results, it again takes longer for all samplers to converge ( K_HEUN took around 150 steps), but we can observe good indicative results much earlier (see: K_HEUN ). Conversely, DDIM and PLMS are still undergoing moderate changes (see: lace around her neck), even at -s300 . In fact, as we can see in this other experiment, some samplers can take 700+ steps to converge when generating people. Note also the point of convergence may not be the most desirable state (e.g. I prefer an earlier version of the face, more rounded), but it will probably be the most coherent arms/hands/face attributes-wise. You can always merge different images with a photo editing tool and pass it through img2img to smoothen the composition. Sampler generation times # Once we understand the concept of sampler convergence, we must look into the performance of each sampler in terms of steps (iterations) per second, as not all samplers run at the same speed. On my M1 Max with 64GB of RAM, for a 512x512 image: | Sampler | (3 sample average) it/s | |---|---| | DDIM | 1.89 | | PLMS | 1.86 | | K_EULER | 1.86 | | K_LMS | 1.91 | | K_HEUN | 0.95 (slower) | | K_DPM_2 | 0.95 (slower) | | K_DPM_2_A | 0.95 (slower) | | K_EULER_A | 1.86 | Combining our results with the steps per second of each sampler, three choices come out on top: K_LMS , K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 (where the latter two run 0.5x as quick but tend to converge 2x as quick as K_LMS ). For creativity and a lot of variation between iterations, K_EULER_A can be a good choice (which runs 2x as quick as K_DPM_2_A ). Additionally, image generation at very low steps (\u2264 -s8 ) is not recommended for K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 . Use K_LMS instead. Three key points # Finally, it is relevant to mention that, in general, there are 3 important moments in the process of image formation as steps increase: The (earliest) point at which an image becomes a good indicator of the final result (useful for batch generation at low step values, to then improve the quality/coherence of the chosen images via running the same prompt and seed for more steps). The (earliest) point at which an image becomes coherent, even if different from the result if steps are increased (useful for batch generation at low step values, where quality/coherence is improved via techniques other than increasing the steps -e.g. via inpainting). The point at which an image fully converges. Hence, remember that your workflow/strategy should define your optimal number of steps, even for the same prompt and seed (for example, if you seek full convergence, you may run K_LMS for -s200 in the case of the red-haired girl, but K_LMS and -s20 -taking one tenth the time- may do as well if your workflow includes adding small details, such as the missing shoulder strap, via img2img ).","title":"SAMPLER CONVERGENCE"},{"location":"help/SAMPLER_CONVERGENCE/#sampler-convergence","text":"As features keep increasing, making the right choices for your needs can become increasingly difficult.

On my M1 Max with 64GB of RAM, for a 512x512 image: | Sampler | (3 sample average) it/s | |---|---| | DDIM | 1.89 | | PLMS | 1.86 | | K_EULER | 1.86 | | K_LMS | 1.91 | | K_HEUN | 0.95 (slower) | | K_DPM_2 | 0.95 (slower) | | K_DPM_2_A | 0.95 (slower) | | K_EULER_A | 1.86 | Combining our results with the steps per second of each sampler, three choices come out on top: K_LMS , K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 (where the latter two run 0.5x as quick but tend to converge 2x as quick as K_LMS ). For creativity and a lot of variation between iterations, K_EULER_A can be a good choice (which runs 2x as quick as K_DPM_2_A ). Additionally, image generation at very low steps (\u2264 -s8 ) is not recommended for K_HEUN and K_DPM_2 . Use K_LMS instead.","title":"Sampler generation times"},{"location":"help/SAMPLER_CONVERGENCE/#three-key-points","text":"Finally, it is relevant to mention that, in general, there are 3 important moments in the process of image formation as steps increase: The (earliest) point at which an image becomes a good indicator of the final result (useful for batch generation at low step values, to then improve the quality/coherence of the chosen images via running the same prompt and seed for more steps). The (earliest) point at which an image becomes coherent, even if different from the result if steps are increased (useful for batch generation at low step values, where quality/coherence is improved via techniques other than increasing the steps -e.g. via inpainting). The point at which an image fully converges. Hence, remember that your workflow/strategy should define your optimal number of steps, even for the same prompt and seed (for example, if you seek full convergence, you may run K_LMS for -s200 in the case of the red-haired girl, but K_LMS and -s20 -taking one tenth the time- may do as well if your workflow includes adding small details, such as the missing shoulder strap, via img2img ).","title":"Three key points"},{"location":"help/TROUBLESHOOT/","text":"F.A.Q. # Frequently-Asked-Questions # Here are a few common installation problems and their solutions.

This error happens with Anaconda on Macs when the Intel-only mkl is pulled in by a dependency. nomkl is a metapackage designed to prevent this, by making it impossible to install mkl , but if your environment is already broken it may not work. Do not use os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True' or equivalents as this masks the underlying issue of using Intel packages. Not enough memory # This seems to be a common problem and is probably the underlying problem for a lot of symptoms (listed below). The fix is to lower your image size or to add model.half() right after the model is loaded. I should probably test it out. I've read that the reason this fixes problems is because it converts the model from 32-bit to 16-bit and that leaves more RAM for other things. I have no idea how that would affect the quality of the images though. See this issue . \"Error: product of dimension sizes > 2**31'\" # This error happens with img2img, which I haven't played with too much yet. But I know it's because your image is too big or the resolution isn't a multiple of 32x32. Because the stable-diffusion model was trained on images that were 512 x 512, it's always best to use that output size (which is the default). However, if you're using that size and you get the above error, try 256 x 256 or 512 x 256 or something as the source image. BTW, 2**31-1 = 2,147,483,647 , which is also 32-bit signed LONG_MAX in C. I just got Rickrolled! Do I have a virus? # You don't have a virus. It's part of the project. Here's Rick and here's the code that swaps him in. It's a NSFW filter, which IMO, doesn't work very good (and we call this \"computer vision\", sheesh). Actually, this could be happening because there's not enough RAM. You could try the model.half() suggestion or specify smaller output images. My images come out black # We might have this fixed, we are still testing. There's a similar issue on CUDA GPU's where the images come out green. Maybe it's the same issue? Someone in that issue says to use \"--precision full\", but this fork actually disables that flag. I don't know why, someone else provided that code and I don't know what it does. Maybe the model.half() suggestion above would fix this issue too. I should probably test it. \"view size is not compatible with input tensor's size and stride\" # File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/ldm/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py\" , line 2511 , in layer_norm return torch.layer_norm ( input, normalized_shape, weight, bias, eps, torch.backends.cudnn.enabled ) RuntimeError: view size is not compatible with input tensor ' s size and stride ( at least one dimension spans across two contiguous subspaces ) .

Values that approach 1.0 allow for lots of variations but will also produce images that are not semantically consistent with the input. See the following example. Input Outputs This procedure can, for example, also be used to upscale samples from the base model.
